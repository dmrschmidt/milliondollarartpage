## About

This is a portfolio website I keep sporadically up to date as a hobby project. It's a collection of the different
things I currently am and have been working on over the past. It's definitely not complete, but at does offer a good
glimpse.

## Usage

After installation, run `yarn install` and then run `yarn start` which will open up a preview of the template in your 
default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. 
You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have yarn installed globally in order to use this build environment.
